# Targets and Triumphs

## Description
Welcome to my Targets and Triumphs React App. Here, you can view the targets that have been set and their progress. You can also view the triumphs or achievements that we want to share. The targets are to help keep the mind focused and on-track, while the triumphs remind us of our achievements and encourage us to persevere during hardships. You'll also find a form for adding a new target or triumph to the list. The progress on the targets can also be adjusted and each card can also be deleted should you choose. 

## Features
This project is a 
- Single page application (SPA) with only one "index.html" file created with React.
- Contains 7 components
- A nav bar element using 3 client-side routes with React Router.
- A json-server containing the data that acts as our backend.

## Installation 
```
npm install
```
**Start**: json server
```
 npm run server 
```
**Start**: React App
```
 npm start
```

## Usage
You start out on the homepage. Here you are greeted with a message and some information. The next tab is Targets. Here, you will see all the targets already set in place that are fetched from the backend. You can use the slider to adjust the progress of each target card and/or you can click the X in the top left to delete the card. The Triumphs tab will show the triumphs already set in place from the backend as well. There's a form element on the top where you can select Target or Triumph from a dropdown, enter the description, and either choose a percentage or date based off the type of dropdown element select. Once you hit submit, you will see a new card show on the respected tab.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
